                <h2>Areas of Interest</h2>
                <p>I am very interested in building and working on full-stack applications that have the potential to enrich the lives of as many people as possible. Besides I am very invested in the recent advancements of Deep Learning Research and applications, especially the usage of LLMs for Search and Retrieval. I also think that autonomous driving is extremely cool.
